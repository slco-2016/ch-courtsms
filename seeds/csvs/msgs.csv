Im planning on attending the victim impact panel scheduled on August 24 unless Matthew has too much homework.  I am not currently taking any prescription medications.  Occasionally I may take something from an old prescription that I didnt use. I will let you know if it is something that may affect testing. I do not have insurance and cannot afford to go to the doctor or pay for medication so I will not be getting any new prescriptions for a while. I will contact you when that changes.  My daily regimen consists of a multivitamin, calcium plus D3, hair skin and nails vitamin, ActiVit, 800 mg ibuprofen, I,000 milligrams Tylenol. OTC meds vary and used PRN. I use NyQuil occasionally and Sudafed for a chronic sinus infection that needs surgery.  Please call me when you get a chance. I would like to discuss the possibility of decreasing/eliminating my drug testing. I spoke with my attorney about talking to the judge about eliminating my drug testing based on the fact I have never nor do I currently use drugs or alcohol. I do not take any prescribed medications and have not taken Ambien for two years.
